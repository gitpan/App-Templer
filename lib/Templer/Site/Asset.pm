=head1 NAME

Templer::Site::Asset - An interface to a site asset.

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use Templer::Site::Asset;

    my $page = Templer::Site::Asset->new( file => "./input/robots.txt" );

=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An asset is anything beneath the input directory which is *not* a page.

Assuming we're not running in "in-place" mode then assets are copied
over to a suitable filename in the output tree.

In C<templer> the page objects are created by the L<Templer::Site> module.

=head1 METHODS

=cut



use strict;
use warnings;


package Templer::Site::Asset;



=head2 new

The constructor.

The single appropriate argument is the hash-key "file", pointing to the
file on-disk.

=cut

sub new
{
    my ( $proto, %supplied ) = (@_);
    my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;

    my $self = {};

    #
    #  Allow user supplied values to override our defaults
    #
    foreach my $key ( keys %supplied )
    {
        $self->{ lc $key } = $supplied{ $key };
    }

    bless( $self, $class );
    return $self;
}


=head2 source

Return the filename we were built from.  This is the value passed
in the constructor.

=cut

sub source
{
    my ($self) = (@_);
    $self->{ "file" };
}
