=head1 METHODS

=cut


use strict;
use warnings;


package Templer::Plugin::ShellCommand;


=head2

Constructor.  No arguments are required/supported.

=cut

sub new
{
    my ( $proto, %supplied ) = (@_);
    my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;

    my $self = {};
    bless( $self, $class );
    return $self;
}


=head2 expand_variables

This is the method which is called by the L<Templer::Plugin::Factory>
to expand the variables contained in a L<Templer::Site::Page> object.

Variables are written in the file in the form "key: value", and are
internally stored within the Page object as a hash.

This method iterates over each key & value and updates any that
seem to refer to shell commands.

=cut

sub expand_variables
{
    my ( $self, $site, $page, $data ) = (@_);

    #
    #  Get the page-variables in the template.
    #
    my %hash = %$data;

    #
    #  Look for a value of "run_command" in each key.
    #
    foreach my $key ( keys %hash )
    {
        if ( $hash{ $key } =~ /^run_command\((.*)\)/ )
        {

            #
            # Run a system command, and capture the output.
            #
            my $cmd = $1;

            #
            #  Strip leading/trailing whitespace.
            #
            $cmd =~ s/^\s+|\s+$//g;

            $hash{ $key } = `$cmd`;
        }

    }

    #
    #  Return.
    #
    return ( \%hash );
}


#
#  Register the plugin.
